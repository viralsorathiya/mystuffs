# SRE Monitoring Standards

## Purpose
This document defines standardized monitoring practices, configurations, and procedures for our SRE team to ensure consistent observability across all systems and environments.

## 1. Monitoring Coverage Standards

### 1.1 Required Monitoring for All Systems
Every system in production must have:
- **Health checks**: Endpoint monitoring with <30s check intervals
- **Resource monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Error rate tracking**: Application and system-level errors
- **Performance metrics**: Response times and throughput
- **Availability monitoring**: Uptime tracking with 99.x% targets

### 1.2 Platform-Specific Requirements

#### Kubernetes Clusters
- Node resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)
- Pod restart counts and failure reasons
- Cluster events and API server health
- Ingress controller performance
- Persistent volume usage and performance

#### Mainframe Systems
- Job completion status and execution times
- System resource consumption
- Transaction response times (CICS/IMS)
- Database performance metrics
- Batch window adherence

#### Applications (All Platforms)
- Request/response metrics (rate, errors, duration)
- Database connection pool status
- External dependency health
- Business logic metrics
- User experience metrics

## 2. Tool Configuration Standards

### 2.1 Tool-Agnostic Configuration
**Monitoring Configuration Structure**: Organize systems logically by environment, platform, and service.
```
Production/
├── Kubernetes/
│   ├── Cluster-East/
│   └── Cluster-West/
├── Mainframe/
│   ├── LPAR-A/
│   └── LPAR-B/
└── Infrastructure/
    ├── Network/
    └── Storage/
```

**Standard Practices**:
- Use appropriate protocols (e.g., SNMP, SSH, WMI, HTTP) for telemetry collection
- Implement custom scripts or plugins for non-standard applications
- Use synthetic transactions for critical workflows and user journeys

**Naming Convention**: `[Environment]-[Platform]-[Service]-[Component]`
